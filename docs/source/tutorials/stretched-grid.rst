Stretched-Grid Simulation: Eastern US 
=====================================

This tutorial walks you through setting up and running a stretched-grid simulation
for ozone in the eastern US. The grid parameters for this tutorial are

=====================     ================
Parameter                 Value
=====================     ================
Stretch-factor            3.6
Cubed-sphere size         C60
Target latitude           37째 N
Target longitude          275째 E
=====================     ================

These parameters were choosen so that the target face covered the eastern US. 
Some back-of-the-envelope resolution calculations are

.. math::

    \mathrm{average\ resolution\ of\ target\ face = R_{tf} \approx \frac{10000\ km}{N \times S} = 46\ km}

and

.. math::

    \mathrm{coarsest\ resolution\ in\ target\ face\ (at\ the\ center) \approx R_{tf} \times 1.2 = 56\ km }

and

.. math::

    \mathrm{finest\ resolution\ in\ target\ face\ (at\ the\ edges) \approx R_{tf} \div 1.2 = 39\ km }

and 

.. math::

    \mathrm{coarsest\ resolution\ globally\ (at\ target\ antipode) \approx R_{tf} \times S^2 \times 1.2 = 720\ km }

where :math:`\mathrm{N}` is the cubed-sphere size and :math:`\mathrm{S}` is the stretch-factor.
The actual value of these, calculated from the grid-box areas, are 46 km, 51 km, 42 km, and 664 km respectively.

.. note::

    This tutorial uses a relatively large stretch-factor. A smaller stretch-factor, like 2.0, would have a 
    refinement that more broad, and the range resolutions would be smaller.

Tutorial prerequisites
----------------------

Before continuing with the tutorial:

* You need to be able to run GCHP simulations
* You need to install gcpy >= 1.0.0, and cartopy >= 0.19
* You need emissions data and MERRA2 data for July 2019

Create a new run directory. This run directory should be use full chemistry
with standard simulation options, and use MERRA2 meteorology. Make the 
following modifications to :file:`runConfig.sh`:

* Change the simulation's start time to :literal:`"20190701 000000"`
* Change the simulation's end time to :literal:`"20190708 000000"`
* Change the simulation's duration to :literal:`"00000007 000000"`
* Change :literal:`timeAvg_freq` to :literal:`"240000"` (daily diagnostics)
* Change :literal:`timeAvg_dur` to :literal:`"240000"` (daily diagnostics)
* Update the compute resources as you like. This simulation's computational
  demands are about :math:`1.5\times` that of a C48 or 2째x2.5째 simulation.
  
.. note::
    I chose to use 30 cores on 1 node, and the simulation took 7 hours
    to run. For comparison, I also ran the simulation on 180 cores across 6 
    nodes, and that took about 2 hours.

.. I started the 30 core simulation at ~3:45--4:00 (

Update :file:`gchp.local.run` so :literal:`nCores` matches your setting in 
:file:`runConfig.sh`. Now you are ready to continue with the tutorial.
The rest of the tutorial assume that your current working directory is your
run directory.


Create your restart file
------------------------

First, create a restart file for the simulation. 
GCHP ingests the restart file directly (no online regridding), so the first thing you need to do is regrid a restart file to your stretched-grid.
You can regrid :file:`initial_GEOSChem_rst.c48_fullchem.nc` with GCPy like so:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m gcpy.file_regrid                           \
        -i initial_GEOSChem_rst.c48_fullchem.nc           \
        --dim_format_in checkpoint                        \
        --dim_format_out checkpoint                       \
        --cs_res_out 60                                   \
        --sg_params_out 3.6 275 37                        \
        -o initial_GEOSChem_rst.EasternUS_SG_fullchem.nc

This creates :file:`initial_GEOSChem_rst.EasternUS_SG_fullchem.nc`, which is the
new restart file for your simulation.

.. note::
   This command takes about a minute to run. If you regridding a large restart file
   (e.g., C180) it may take significantly longer.

Update :file:`runConfig.sh`
---------------------------

Make the following updates to :file:`runConfig.sh`:

* Change :literal:`INITIAL_RESTART` to use :file:`initial_GEOSChem_rst.EasternUS_SG_fullchem.nc`
* Change :literal:`CS_RES` to :literal:`60`
* Change :literal:`STRETCH_GRID` to :literal:`ON`
* Change :literal:`STRETCH_FACTOR` to :literal:`3.6`
* Change :literal:`TARGET_LAT` to :literal:`37.0`
* Change :literal:`TARGET_LON` to :literal:`275.0`

Execute :file:`runConfig.sh` to apply the updates to the various configuration files:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./runConfig.sh


Run GCHP
--------

Run GCHP:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./gchp.local.run


Plot the output
---------------

Append grid-box corners:


.. code-block:: console

        --sg_params 3.6 275 37 \
        OutputDir/GCHP.SpeciesConc.20190707_1200z.nc4

Plot ozone at model level 22:

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import cartopy.crs as ccrs
    import xarray as xr

    # Load 24-hr average concentrations for 2019-07-07
    ds = xr.open_dataset('GCHP.SpeciesConc.20190707_1200z.nc4')

    # Get Ozone at level 22
    ozone_data = ds['SpeciesConc_O3'].isel(time=0, lev=22).squeeze()

    # Setup axes
    ax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.EqualEarth())
    ax.set_global()
    ax.coastlines()

    # Plot data on each face
    for face_idx in range(6):
        x = ds.corner_lons.isel(nf=face_idx)
        y = ds.corner_lats.isel(nf=face_idx)
        v = ozone_data.isel(nf=face_idx)
        pcm = plt.pcolormesh(
            x, y, v, 
            transform=ccrs.PlateCarree(),
            vmin=20e-9, vmax=100e-9
        )
    
    plt.colorbar(pcm, orientation='horizontal')
    plt.show()
