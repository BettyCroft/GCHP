Stretched-grid simulations
==========================

There are two steps to running a stretched-grid simulation:

#. You need a restart file for your specific stretched-grid. The easiest way
   to get this is by regridding an existing restart file with GCPy.
#. You need to update the appropriate parameters in :file:`runConfig.sh`.

Before setting up a stretched-grid simulation, you need to decide on an appropriate
stretched-grid for your application.
